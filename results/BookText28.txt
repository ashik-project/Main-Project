ABSTRACT
    This is a program which makes 
remembering
 things easy. Because it is a lot more 
efficient than traditiona
l study methods.
 Users 
can greatly
 decrease time spend on studying and
 greatly 
increase the amount they learn. There is two simple concepts behind this program, 
Repetition and recall testing
   Our brains are efficient 
machines
, and they rapidly discard information that 
doesn™t
 seem useful, it applies to everything we learn. 
If you spend an afternoon 
memorizing
 some science 
terms and then 
don™t
 think about tha
t material for two 
weeks,
 you™ll pro
bably 
have 
forgotten
 most 
of it. 
In fact some studies show we forget about 75% of material learnt within 48 hour period. 
This 
can seem pretty depressing when you need to 
learn
 a lot of information
. The 
solution is simple , 
review. The
 only problem is that tradition
al review is not very practical. If you are using flash 
cards
 its easy to flick through al
l of them
 to review. 
This 
application generates flash cards for the 
user.
 Flash
 card are generated by identifying important sentences using NLP & TF
-IDF
   Recall testing means being asked a question and trying 
remember
 the answer. 
This 
application can generate questions from user provided text
/PDF
 and 
can provide mock test to get 
an idea about how much they 
remember
.
