ABSTRACT
    This is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is a lot more 
efficient than traditional study methods. Users can greatly decrease time spend on studying and 
greatly 
increase the amount they learn. There is two simple 
concepts behind this program, 
Repetition and recall testing
   Our brains are efficient machines, and they rapidly discard information that doesn™t 
seem useful, it applies to everything we learn. If you spend an afternoon memorizing some science 
terms and t
hen don™t think about that material for two weeks, you™ll probably have forgotten most 
of it. In fact some studies show we forget about 75% of material learnt within 48 hour period. This 
can seem pretty depressing when you need to learn a lot of informatio
n. The solution is simple , 
review. The only problem is that traditional review is not very practical. If you are using flash 
cards its easy to flick through all of them to review. This application generates flash cards for the 
user.
 Flash card are generat
ed by identifying important sentences using NLP & TF
-IDF
   Recall testing means being asked a question and trying remember the answer. This 
application can generate questions from user provided text

 and 
provide
s mock test to get an 
idea about how much 
they remember.
